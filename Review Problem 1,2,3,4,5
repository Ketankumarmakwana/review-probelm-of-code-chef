1) chef and chefina stay in hotel

if X%10!=0 or Y%1!=0:
        if X%10!=0 and Y%10!=0:
            N=(X//10)+1
            M=(Y//10)+1
            Z=N-M
            print(abs(Z))
        elif X%10!=0:
            N=(X//10)+1
            M=Y//10
            Z=N-M
            print(abs(Z))
        elif Y%10!=0:
            M=(Y//10)+1
            N=X//10
            Z=N-M
            print(abs(Z))
    else:
        N=X//10
        M=Y//10
        Z=N-M
        print(abs(Z))


2) Chef is playing a video game, and is getting close to the end. He decides to finish the rest of the game in a single session.

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    X, Y, Z = map(int, input().split())
    if X<=3:
        print(X*Y)
    else:
        if X%3==0:
             print((X*Y)+((X//3)-1)*Z)
        else:
            print((X*Y)+((X//3))*Z)
3)Chef has made a list for his monthly expenses. The list has  N expenses with index 1 to N. The money spent on each expense depends upon the monthly income of Chef.

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    N, X = map(int, input().split())
    sum1=2**X
    i=1
    while i<=N:
        sum1=sum1//2
        i=i+1
    print(sum1)
    
 4)There are two problems in a contest.Problem A is worth 500500 points at the start of the contest.Problem B is worth 10001000 points at the start of the contest.
 Once the contest starts, after each minute:Maximum points of Problem A reduce by 2 points .Maximum points of Problem B reduce by 4 points.
 answer: 
 
 t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    X, Y = map(int, input().split())
    A2B=(500-2*X)+(1000-4*(X+Y))
    B2A=(1000-4*Y)+(500-2*(X+Y))
    if A2B<=B2A:
        print(B2A)
    else:
        print(A2B)
   
 5)There are 10 problems in a contest. You know that the score of each problem is either 1 or 100 points.Chef came to know the total score of a
 participant and he is wondering how many problems were actually solved by that participant.Given the total score P of the participant, 
 determine the number of problems solved by the participant. Print âˆ’1 in case the score is invalid.
 
 Ans:
      t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    P = int(input())
    if P<10:
        print(P)
    elif (P%100==0):
        print(P//100)
    elif (P%100)<10:
        print((P%10)+1)
    else:
        print(-1)
